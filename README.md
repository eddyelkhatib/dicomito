# DICOMITO v0.9

This is the preliminary version of the dicomito utility program. This simple program provides the possibility to extract regions of interest from dicom files (eg. extract only the tumor from a CT scan).

## Requirements

This program relies mainly on the [pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) libraries.

`> pip3 install numpy opencv-python pydicom`
